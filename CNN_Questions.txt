Q3: What happens when you train a Convolutional Neural Network without normalization as a preprocessing step?

Q4: In no more than two sentences, how do you differentiate MLPs vs CNNs? 

Q5: What defines an edge or edges in a convolutional neural networks? 

Q6: When can you use a convolutional kernel with values that DOES NOT add to zero? Give one use case.

Q7: How can you use Convolutional Neural Networks to detect primary/major colors in the image? (trick question)

Q8: Given a CNN that outputs values that will be subsequently flattened to a fully connected layer for classification, is it possible to reconstruct the original image? (A privacy-related question)

Minute 40 of CS231n Winter 2016

Ans: Yes, but as it is passed through the several convolution and pooling layers, only the inherent structures are preserved. Reconstruction goes like this, given a particular feature, find an image that bests matches that feature, match that code and subject to regularizer on the image.
Instead of maximizing on every arbitrary feature we just want to have a specific feature that we match into every single dimension.

You can start from middle features or final pooling layers and see whether you get reconstructions that are similar to the original image and regularize to get just 1.

Guys please watch this especially from minute 41. It is amazing and quite scary at the same time!

Q9: Explain the vulnerabilities of using Convolutional Neural Networks.
primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature and very high dimensional, sparsely-populated input spaces.
