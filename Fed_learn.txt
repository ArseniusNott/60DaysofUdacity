Federated Learning:
> a specific environment for machine learning where the actual training of model is somehow democratized to multiple machines (edge devices) instead of the usual centralized modeling on a single one. 
> This limits access to local data across multiple users that would normally be submitted to the central server for modeling. 
> In this case, sensitive information from users stay within the users' devices.
These machines will then train their mini models and outputs aggregated version of the data called focused update. 
> With the power of differential privacy, these updates are then augmented with noise so even these aggregates will not leak private information (more on this later).

Federated learning is a tool to break what sometimes comes up as a false dichotomy that if you want to have really sophisticated machine learning, you have to give up privacy.
